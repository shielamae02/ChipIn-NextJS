# ChipIn - Expense Splitter Web Application

ChipIn is a powerful, web-based expense splitter application that makes managing shared expenses effortless for trips, events, or everyday household management. The app allows users to easily divide costs among groups without manual calculations, and its web-based nature means there's no need for everyone to install anything—anyone with access to the session link can join, track, and modify expenses in real time. ChipIn handles scenarios where expenses are paid by one or more individuals and automatically generates a transparent settlement breakdown, ensuring seamless, fair, and stress-free expense management.
